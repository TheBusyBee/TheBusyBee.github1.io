This quality control tool measures the change in level within a sample vessel (microplate well, micro-tube, vial, reagent container, test tube) on the addition or subtraction of substance within the sample vessel. The substance can be either liquid or solid.</p><img class="img-responsive pull-left" src="Images/BeeSure/BeeSure.png" /><p>Using a different sensing technology, BeeSure adds to life science lab automation the same function that vision QC systems provide for large scale industrial manufacturing processes. Proactively detect a faulty dispensing system or blocked tip during pipetting operations. Verify that all the wells in a microplate were as they should have been both before and after the pipetting task in your workflow. Ensure that you have enough substance in a reagent supply vial or reservoir to complete a run with your automation system. Continuously monitor your processes to validate and document their execution before wasting high value samples and reagents because you were unaware of a system failure.</p><p>BeeSure is easy and intuitive to use, only requiring one standard electrical output and a very small space on your automation platform, sample deck or lab bench. Place multiple BeeSure units at different nodes in your work flow to increase throughput and efficiency.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12 features"><a class="btn btn-primary" href="/information.html" target="_blank" role="button">Request Quote</a><a class="btn btn-primary" href="DataSheets/LIT-50001_Rev.B_BeeSure_Level_Sensing_System.pdf" target="_blank" role="button">Product Data sheet</a></div></div><h3><i>Key Features and Benefits</i></h3><ul><li>96-well plates (std. or deep) and tube racks in 30 seconds. 384-well plates in 2 minutes at standard precision (±0.1 mm)</li><li>Topographic map for any surface within an ANSI/SBS footprint.
